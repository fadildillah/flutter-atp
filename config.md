## iOS Configuration for Dependencies

### Location

To use location services in iOS, you need to add the following permissions in `Info.plist`:

- `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription`: This is probably the only one you need. Background location is supported by this, but a blue badge is shown in the status bar when the app is using location services while in the background.
- `NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription`: Deprecated, use `NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription` instead.
- `NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription`: Use this very carefully. This key is required only if your iOS app uses APIs that access the userâ€™s location information at all times, even if the app isn't running.

To receive location updates when the application is in the background, add the following property list key to `Info.plist`:

- `UIBackgroundModes` with the string value `location`.
